JPA/Hibernate homework


Structure:
ApplicationRunner - class containing console operations logic
UserService - receives "ConsoleRequest" objects and manages entity classes
*Repository - contains JPA logic itself. Saves, updates and gets entity objects
User and UserDetails - JPA entities. These objects will be converted to SQL queries. EntityManager (primary JPA class) works with those objects ONLY


Task
1. Understand how does the application work!
2. Move user creation logic from ApplicationRunner to UserService
3. ApplicationRunner reads console input and calls the methods of UserService
4. Implement UserDetails functionality:
- add fields: address (should be unique)
- implement missing repository methods
- implement UserDetails service

5. Implement console functionality (minimal viable ̶p̶r̶o̶d̶u̶c̶t̶ task)
- Should have User CRUD from console to database (including get all and get one)

6. Implement console functionality (high complexity)
- Implement CRUD for user details by user id.
- Implement "search by city" and "search by country" (See UserDetail JPQL example for details)
- User list should contain all user fields and if to get user by id - it is necessary to show all the information
